 * Assume two populations A and B have been isolated until time tau in the past as measured from the present.

 * Let TW denote the time until coalescence for two lines when drawn from the same population, 
 * and Tb when drawn from different populations. 
 * Let lambdaA denote the coalescence rate for two lines in population A, and 
 * lambdaAB for the common ancestral population AB.
